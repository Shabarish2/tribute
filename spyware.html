    <h1>A Tribute To India's Covid Warriors.</h1>
<p>
    The Covid-19 pandemic is one of the most dangerous challenges this world has faced in our lifetime. It is above all a human crisis with severe health and socio-economic consequences. Needless to say, doctors, nurses and people working in health-care sectors are particularly vulnerable to the highly infectious disease. 
     </p>
     <p>
        The list of the sleep-deprived heroes includes doctors, nurses, medical cleaners, pathologists, paramedics, ambulance drivers, and health-care administrators, the brave medical army and medical researchers working day in and night out against all odds.
</p>
<h2>SALUTE TO THE CORONA MARTYRS</h2>
<p>   
    "The nation is indebted to all the doctors, nurses and other health workers who have been front line warriors in this fight against the coronavirus."</p>
<p>
    Since the coronavirus outbreak, health-care professionals have not only experienced the gratification of healing patients and saving their lives but have also lost many battles along the way. On top of that, many doctors have even sacrificed their own lives in the line of duty. Every day, the selfless warriors are giving it their all in health-care settings while cutting themselves off from their families and loved ones. The sacrifice that they are making for the safety and welfare of humanity is priceless and deserves lifelong gratitude on our end.</p>
<p>
We are all in midst of a war. War against nature and time, and the warriors in this fight are our front line health care workers and doctors.
</p>
<p>
    We all learned many important lessons in the year 2020.Like climate change, this epidemic has also raised the consciousness that the destiny of every member of the world community is interlinked. Most importantly, we must reassess the value health-care workers hold in our lives and the kind of treatment they get from us.  
</p>
<p>
    While the deadly virus has brought attention to the inadequacies in the health-care systems across the globe, doctors and health-care workers have been risking their lives to save all of us. They are also risking the lives of their family members, which indeed is a huge sacrifice. On top of that, the shortage of face masks, shields, and protective gear is not helping. And this makes the efforts of the medical workers even more extraordinary. 
</p>
<p>
    They deserve all the appreciation and support. The sacrifice of doctors and healthcare workers across the globe will not go to waste. Humanity will always be grateful to them for what they are doing during these unprecedented times. The respect for healthcare professionals has grown manifolds in the hearts of people.
